# Pokemon api client

This project is created for learning and simple referencing when needed. It demostrates the following
- Api calls (fetching)
- Hooks, useState and useEffect
- Auto scrolling to top
- Callback functions
- Lazy loading
- Searching [filtering]
- Modal for profiles

# Tools

# Purpose
The purpose of this project is to explore api calls using the react ecosystem and javascript. The stripped down design is to focus on the mechanisms and avoid wasting time on the aesthetics [css].  

# Note
Because of the nature of this project, it is deeply integrated with the pokemon Api https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon . Most components in the retrieval is hardcoded for the server only and parts cannot be used in other api servers.

For anyone who is beginning to learn react, I advise to create the same project, without help from external packages such as redux or react-modal, most features created is done without packages except for SWR for api calls and pagination.

# Still to do or to improve
* Add description to selected profiles
* A loading component, instead of the loading text

# To Run

- download the packages $npm init
- run $npm start
- open http://localhost:3000
